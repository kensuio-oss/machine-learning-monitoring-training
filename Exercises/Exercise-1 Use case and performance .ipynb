    "\n",
    "Throughout the class of Monitoring Machine Learning Models in Python, we will use a freely adapted version of the `Bank Marketing` dataset (you can find the original version [here]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)). The dataset has been modified for our example. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will familiarize you with the use case and the data we are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bank Marketing` dataset is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a data team, you were asked to identify the customers who are most likely to subscribe for a new term deposit. A well-targeted customer is expected to make the company earn a gross revenue of `$70`. Each phone call costs `$5` to the bank. The business team wants to minimise the phone call marketing costs, and therefore wants that:\n",
    "- about `70%` of the calls result in a subscription,\n",
    "- the profit (gross revenue - costs) resulting from the campaign should be min `$6000`/month\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the bank has a capacity of `300` calls per month.  \n",

    "### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are available in the working directory, in the `data` folder. For each month, we have collected a list of potential customers we would like to reach out. Let's have a look at the dataset for `january`"
