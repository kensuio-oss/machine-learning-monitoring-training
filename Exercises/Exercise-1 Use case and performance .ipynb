    "Throughout the class of Monitoring Machine Learning Models in Python, we will use a freely adapted version of the `Bank Marketing` dataset (you can find the original version [here]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)). The dataset has been modified for our example. \n",

A well-targeted customer is expected to make the company earn a gross revenue of `$70`. Each phone call costs `$5` to the bank. The business team wants to minimise the phone call marketing costs, and therefore wants that:\n",
    "- about `70%` of the calls result in a subscription,\n",
    "- the profit (gross revenue - costs) resulting from the campaign should be min `$6000`/month\n",
